# MinUImg

MinUImg is a minimalistic TUI application written in go. Its purpose is to resize and convert images from png, jpg and
webp formats to png and jpg formats.

I have made this application because I have way too many retro handhelds with multiple firmware. Some of them support png,
other jpeg, some want images with fixed width. I wanted a simple way to convert and resize images to the correct format
and size.

Theses devices are amazing, they are cheap, have a lot of emulators and are very portable.
They usually run on linux or android. You can even install custom firmware on some of them.

Here are some of the devices I own:
- Miyoo Mini with OnionOS
- Trimui Smart Pro with Crossmix and Knulli
- Trimui Brick with Minui
- And so much more...
